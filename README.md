# 3D-U-Net-with-ConvLSTM-for-Cloud-Prediction-using-SEVIR-Data
This project implements an advanced deep learning solution for cloud prediction using satellite infrared data from the SEVIR (Storm EVent ImageRy) dataset. The model predicts 6 future cloud frames (30+ minutes ahead) from 12 input frames with high spatial resolution (192√ó192 pixels)
# 3D U-Net Cloud Prediction with ConvLSTM

Built advanced 3D U-Net model with ConvLSTM for SEVIR weather prediction using TensorFlow, achieving 0.88 Dice score, 0.88 IoU for accurate cloud forecasting in severe weather early warnings.

## üå©Ô∏è Project Overview
